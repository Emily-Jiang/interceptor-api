An interceptor binding type is a Java
annotation defined as Retention(RUNTIME). Typically an interceptor
binding is defined as Target(\{TYPE, METHOD, CONSTRUCTOR}) or any subset
of valid target types.

An interceptor binding type may be declared
by specifying the InterceptorBinding meta-annotation.
