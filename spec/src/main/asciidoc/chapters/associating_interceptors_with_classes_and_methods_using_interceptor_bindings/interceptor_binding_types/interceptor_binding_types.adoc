=== Interceptor Binding Types

An interceptor binding type is a Java
annotation defined as _Retention(RUNTIME)_. Typically an interceptor
binding is defined as _Target({TYPE, METHOD, CONSTRUCTOR})_ or any subset
of valid target types.

An interceptor binding type may be declared
by specifying the InterceptorBinding meta-annotation.
