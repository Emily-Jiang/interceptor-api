=== Specification Scope

Jakarta Interceptors defines a means of interposing on business
method invocations and specific events—such as lifecycle
events and timeout events—that occur on instances of Jakarta EE
components and other managed classes.

An interceptor method is either a method of the component class
(called the target class) or a method of a separate class
(called the interceptor class) that is associated with the target
class.
