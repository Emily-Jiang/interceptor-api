:fn-1: footnote:fn1[If a PostConstruct \
interceptor method is declared in the interceptor class or a superclass \
of the interceptor class, it is not invoked when the interceptor \
instance itself is created.]

:fn-2: footnote:fn2[If a PreDestroy \
interceptor method is declared in the interceptor class or a superclass \
of the interceptor class, it is not invoked when the interceptor \
instance itself is destroyed.]

:fn-3: footnote:fn3[If the last parameter \
is a vararg parameter of type T, it is considered be equivalent to a \
parameter of type T{opening-bracket}{closing-bracket}.]

:fn-4: footnote:fn4[In case of the \
PostConstruct interceptor, if there is no callback method defined on the \
target class, the invocation of InvocationContext.proceed method in \
the last interceptor method in the chain validates the target instance.]

:fn-5: footnote:fn5[In general, a \
lifecycle callback interceptor method will be invoked in an unspecified \
transaction context. Note however that singleton and stateful session \
beans support the use of a transaction context for the invocation of \
lifecycle callback interceptor methods (see the Jakarta Enterprise \
Beans specification {opening-bracket}<<bib2>>{closing-bracket}). The \
transaction context may be also changed by transactional interceptors in \
the invocation chain.]

:fn-6: footnote:fn6[Note that the \
transaction context may be changed by transactional interceptors in the \
invocation chain.]

:fn-7: footnote:fn7[This requirement follows the rules from the Jakarta Annotations specification, section 2.1 <<bib5>>.]

:fn-8: footnote:fn8[The Priority annotation also orders interceptors. See Chapter <<interceptor_ordering>>.]
